# Find the GCD of two numbers

## AIM:
To write a program to find the GCD of two numbers using function.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm

## Step1:
Define a function.
## Step2:
Get the two numbers from the user.
## Step3:
Compare the two values, to find the smaller number.
## Step4:
Use while () loop to find the GCD of the two numbers.

## Program:
# Program to find the gcd of number using functions
# Developed By: HARIHARAN J
# RegisterNumber: 23011967
```
def gcd():
    a=int(input())
    b=int(input())
    while b!=0:
        a,b=b,a%b
    print("GCD of two numbers is:",a)
```

## Output:

## Result:
Thus the program to find the GCD of two numbers is written and verified using python programming.
